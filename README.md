#Final Exam

1. Download the web1010final.html file and create a new github repo named web1010final

3. Make it so that when the "Learn More" button is clicked, this button hides and the form (which was previously hidden) appears. (20pts)

4. Make it so that when the "Send me info!" button is clicked, the form posts asynchronously to the same endpoint used during the practice final (fvi-grad.com:4004/fakeform) (20pts)

5. Ensure the form posts correctly (form field names are correct). (20pts)

6. Make sure the form is posted with ajax and that the user gets some kind of visual feedback when the form submission button is clicked. for instance, the caption of the button can change to "sending..." upon click and then change to "Message Sent!" when the ajax response comes back. (20pts)
